slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 6280 ON node-1 CANCELLED AT 2023-09-22T18:09:13 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[34098,0],0] on node node-1
  Remote daemon: [[34098,0],5] on node node-6

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
